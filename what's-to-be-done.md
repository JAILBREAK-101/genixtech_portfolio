🚀 From Code to Impact: My Journey in AI, Web, and Software Engineering
Technology isn’t just about writing code—it’s about solving real problems, unlocking new possibilities, and shaping the future. That’s where I come in.

I specialize in AI, Web Development, and Software Engineering, building solutions that don’t just work but scale, adapt, and create lasting impact.

🔹 Innovation & Emerging Tech → I explore and integrate Web3, decentralized AI, and quantum computing to stay ahead of the curve.

🚀 The Value I Bring

How to Do It Right as a Young Developer
1️⃣ Focus on cash flow first: Get paid projects/clients before going "full business mode."
2️⃣ Keep learning & improving: Your skills should be 10x better before scaling.
3️⃣ Don't get stuck in company formalities too soon: A business is not an idea or registration—it's people paying for your solutions.
4️⃣ Build in public: Share your journey, lessons, and wins online. It attracts opportunities.
5️⃣ Use projects as stepping stones: Subtilo isn’t just a project—it’s proof of your execution. Use it to get inbound interest and build credibility.

Final Thought
If you build momentum first, when the time comes to officially scale into a business, you'll have:
✅ Real customers
✅ A strong reputation
✅ A proven concept
✅ Financial stability
